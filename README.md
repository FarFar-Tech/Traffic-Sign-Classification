The original dataset has 73,139 images and 43 classes. We reduced the size of the dataset into 24,091
images with considering only speed signs (9 first classes). The size of the image is 32*32 pixels. Both
datasets are accessible in Moodle: “sign.zip” and “sign_small.zip”.After loading the dataset, split
the data in train (80%) and test (20%).
